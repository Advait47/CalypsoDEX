CalypsoDEX is a decentralized exchange (DEX) platform deployed on the Binance Smart Chain Testnet. It enables trading of a custom token, **Calypso (CALY)**, and uses a simulated **Demo-USDT** for testing transactions. With an intuitive user interface built in React and integrated Web3.js connectivity, CalypsoDEX offers several features including a referral-based registration system, token buying/selling, free USDT claims, and an admin panel for contract management.
